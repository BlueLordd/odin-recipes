    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the mutton pieces thoroughly, pat them dry and add in a bowl. To this, add ginger garlic paste, lemon juice, red chilli powder, turmeric, salt, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala and green chillies. Top it with some oil and give it a good mix so that the marination reaches each piece. Keep this aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add some oil in a hot pan and add the marinated mutton pieces to it. Sprinkle some water over it and once the mutton pieces get a bit colour on all sides. Now add about 1 ½ cup of water, put the lid on and let this cook for about 30-35 minutes. Once cooked properly, remove the lid and let the remaining water evaporate.</li>
        <li>Take maida in a bowl and add 1 tbsp of ghee in it with 1 pinch of salt and 1 tsp of sugar. Knead a smooth dough. Let it rest for 20 minutes. Now, make small dough balls out of it and roll into a chapati or a multi-layered paratha and cook on a hot tawa.</li>
        <li>Now that we have everything ready, add the cooked mutton pieces on the paratha and top it with some pickled onions, coriander leaves, chat masala and to enhance the taste, you can also add some green mint and coriander chutney. Roll it and serve hot!</li>
